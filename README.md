# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. The application provides animations for each algorithm, highlighting the steps and movements involved in sorting a list of elements. Additionally, it displays the time and space complexities of each algorithm, making it a valuable educational tool for students and developers.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Visual Animations:** Animates the sorting process step-by-step for a clear understanding of how each algorithm works.
- **Complexity Information:** Displays time and space complexities for each sorting algorithm.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Includes a variety of sorting algorithms for comparison.
